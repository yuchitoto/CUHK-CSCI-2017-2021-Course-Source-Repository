In particular, we would like to know whether other features of attendees are a good predictor of how successful they found this scikit-learn tutorial. A very common pattern you will see in machine learning based on starting DataFrames is to drop one (or more) column for the X features, and keep that one for the y target.\n",

    "In my analysis, I felt a binary measure of success was more relevant than a scalar measure initially collected as a 1-10 scale. Moreover, if the target is simplified this way, it becomes appropriate to use a *classification* algorithm as opposed to a *regression* algorithm. It would be a mistake to treat the 1-10 scale as a categorical consisting of 10 independent labels—there is something inherently ordinal about these labels, although scikit-learn will happily calculate models as if there is not. On the other hand, responses to this ordinal question is generally non-uniform in distribution, usually with a clustering of values near the top values.\n",
